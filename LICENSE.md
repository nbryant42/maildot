## Summary

The source code of this project is publicly available, but this is a custom, non-OSI-approved license and is not
"open source" under the OSI definition.

Commercialization and binary distribution of this software or any derivative works is prohibited without explicit
permission from the author. That means you can run and experiment with the source code locally, but you can't productize
it or charge money for it.

Because of the restrictions on binary distribution, this license is not compatible with the GPL. Some open source
package repositories may not accept artifacts with this license.

  the same license. Contributions may require signing a CLA; details will be provided before merging PRs.

### You may not:

- Distribute compiled binaries of this software or any derivative works, whether for commercial purposes or not,
  whether internally within an organization or to third parties, without explicit permission from the author.
